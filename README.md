⛓️‍💥  Business Problem- Each location operates nine types of machines, continuously transmitting performance data every 10 minutes. Ther eare certain machines which are not healthy and affecting the performance.
🎯Goals- The primary goal of this telemetry collection was to address two critical operational questions: ✅ Which factory experienced the highest machine failure rate? ✅ Which machines were most frequently impacted at that location?
👩‍💼Business Impact:To answer these pressing questions, I leveraged the power of Tableau. This dashboard enables Atlique's tech team to: 
  🔹 Visualize EV sales by each naker  further pronged into two-wheeler and 4-wheeler sales
  🔹 Identify trends that influence EV sales by each category and state
